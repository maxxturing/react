# react

- Components
  - We create components in react for different parts of our application
    - navbar
    - Search box
    - Footer
  - Reacts injects them into the DOM - creates virtual dom and renders that to the browser
  - React creates a new virtual DOM when a change in state or data occurs
    - Only updates that one part, that's why it's quick
